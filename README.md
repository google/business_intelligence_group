# Business Intelligence Group - Marketing Analysis & Data Science Solution Packages

##### This is not an official Google product.

## Overview
This repository contains multiple notebook solution packages (fastDTW, etc.) for Marketing Analysts and Data Scientists to optimize experimental design and causal inference analysis (geo split, causal impact analysis etc.)

### Motivation to develop and open the source code

Some marketing practitioners pay attention to
[Causal inference in statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference). However,
using time series data without parallel trend assumptions does not allow for
appropriate analysis. Therefore, the purpose is to enable the implementation and
analysis of interventions after classifying time-series data for which parallel
trend assumptions can be made.
