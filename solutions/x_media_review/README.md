# Cross-Media Review with same level

##### This is not an official Google product.

Advertisers often use many media to achieve their goals, but because standardsvary from one medium to another,
it can be difficult to properly evaluate strategies and make appropriate decisions.

By using Google Analytics 4 conversions, the media that directly drive sessions are limited,
but multiple media can be evaluated at the same level.

By providing the monthly investment amount for each medium,
it produces consistent output about the effectiveness and efficiency of each measure, which is what marketers want to know.


## Overview

### What you can do with Cross-Media Review with same level

-   Visualization of effectiveness and efficiency in time series
-   Visualization of monthly differences in effectiveness for each media
-   Visualization of monthly efficiency by media


### Motivation to develop and open the source code

There are cases where the effectiveness and efficiency of media with different standards are evaluated as they are,
and cases where media with different roles are evaluated with the same standards (last click model).
In these cases, there is a possibility that resources are not being allocated to measures that are truly contributing to acquisition,
so we created this to reduce this possibility and improve productivity.
