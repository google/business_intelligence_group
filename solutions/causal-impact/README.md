# CausalImpact with experimental design

##### This is not an official Google product.

CausalImpact is a R package for causal inference using Bayesian structural
time-series models. In using CausalImpact, the parallel trend assumption is
needed for counterfactual modeling, so this code performs classification of time
series data based on DTW distances.

## Overview

### What you can do with CausalImpact with experiment design

-   Experimental Design
    -   load time series data from google spreadsheet or csv file
    -   classify time series data so that parallel trend assumptions can be made
    -   simulate the conditions required for verification
-   CausalImpact Analysis
    -   load time series data from google spreadsheet or csv file
    -   CausalImpact Analysis

### Motivation to develop and open the source code

Some marketing practitioners pay attention to
[Causal inference in statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference).ã€€However,
using time series data without parallel trend assumptions does not allow for
appropriate analysis. Therefore, the purpose is to enable the implementation and
analysis of interventions after classifying time-series data for which parallel
trend assumptions can be made.

### Typical procedure for use

1. Assume a hypothetical solution to the issue and its factors.
2. Assume room for KPIs and the mechanisms that drive KPIs depending on the solution.
3. In advance, decide next-actions to be taken for each result of hypothesis testing (with/without significant difference).
    - Recommend supporting the mechanism with relevant data other than KPIs
4. Prepare time-series KPI data for at least 100 time points.
    - Regional segmentation is recommended.
    - Previous data, such as the previous year, may make a difference in the market environment.
    - Relevant data must be independent and unaffected by interventions
5. **(Experimental Design)** This tool is used to conduct the experimental design. 
    - Split into groups that are closest to each other where the parallel trend assumption can be placed.
    - Simulation of required timeframe and budget
    - :warning: If the parallel trend assumption cannot be placed, we recommend considering another approach
6. Implemented interventions.
7. Prepare time-series KPI data, including intervention period and assumed residual period, in addition to previous data.
8. **(CausalImpact Analysis)** Conduct CausalImpact analysis.
9. Implement next actions based on results of hypothesis testing

## Getting started

1.  Prepare the time series data on spreadsheet or csv file
2.  Open ipynb file with **[Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/business_intelligence_group/blob/main/solutions/causal-impact/CausalImpact_with_Experimental_Design.ipynb)** Button.
3.  Run cells in sequence

## Tutorial
#### CausalImpact Analysis Section

1. Press the **Connect** button to connect to the runtime

2. Run **Step 1** cell. Step 1 cells take a little longer because they install the [tfcausalImpact library](https://github.com/WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact).<br>If you do so, you will see some selections in the Step 1 cell.

3. In question 1, choose **CausalImpact Analysis** and update period before the intervention(**Pre Start & Pre End**) and the period during the intervention(**Post Start and Post End**).<br>

4. In question 2, please select the data source from **google_spreadsheet**, **CSV_file**, or **Big_Query**.<br>
    Then enter the required items.<br>
    ![ci_step1_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61218928/219256224-47af732f-f3d6-4a46-8eea-fb8eb13f82b8.png)

5. After entering the required items, the data format will be selected. For CausalImpact analysis, please prepare the data in **wide format** in advance.<br>
    After selecting wide format, enter the **date column name**.<br>
    ![ci_step1_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61218928/219256241-52ab2ad7-a3e7-413c-b27b-b397867ba89c.png)

6. Once the items are filled in, run the **Step 2** cell. <br>
    (:warning: If you have selected **google_spreadsheet** or **big_query**, a pop-up will appear regarding granting permission, so please grant it to Colab.) 
    
7. After Step 2 is executed, you will see **the results of CausalImpact Analysis**.

    * A: divide_equally divides the time series data into n groups with similar movements.
    * B: similarity_selection extracts n groups that move similarly to a particular column.
